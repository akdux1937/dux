    "PDFs are hard to work with. Over the years I've tried several approaches to filling them out in an automated way. It's amazing my job has so many manual tasks that require filling out PDFs. It's fairly routine for me to be manually filling out PDF files to process transactions. Needless to say I've either created or borrowed several solutions. First let me say I'm no VBA expert but I have experimented with solutions here as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've wrote a VBA script to fill out a PDF using \"send keys\". Think \"how could I do everything by use of just the keyboard shortcuts?\" Once you know how to open a PDF with shortcuts, tab through the form fields and use shortcuts to save, you can automate this in VBA. The problem here is that it's painstaking to set up. Plus if the form changes or you want to add a new form it's basically like starting from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next I used VBA and the Acrobat reference to access and manipulate PDFs. This works much better because you can access the PDF form fields using VBA and Java Script. I would highly recommend this route if you're going to use VBA. I still felt as if every PDF template had to be setup completely separate. Some of this is likely due to my experience level with VBA. Either way there was a lot of copying a pasting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then came my experience with Python, PyPDF2 and reportlab. I won't go into too much detail about exactly how I did this. In short you create your PDF template, create blank PDF with just your data fields, and paste the new PDF as a watermark on top of your PDF template. Again, this is painstaking because you're using grid coordinates to position where text should be placed on the page. This worked, it was fast, but it wasn't great if the PDF template changed or if you wanted to manipulate the PDF file afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was great when I found you could fill PDF form fields with python using PyPDF2 and pdfrw. Both of these libraries look to be able to do similar tasks but I chose pdfrw because it appears to be maintained better. PyPDF2 actually is no longer maintained. There is a PyPDF3 and PyPDF4; however, I already settled on pdfrw. The only issue I ran into is that you could fill in the fields but those values wouldn't show until you refreshed the field in Acrobat. I found two ways around this; one was to click into every field and hit `Enter`. This option isn't doable if you have several PDFs. The next was to open the PDFs in a web browser which causes a refresh of the fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these challenges I gave up for a while... However, while digging into Python and PDFs again I found the solution that refreshes the fields!\n",
    "\n",
    "So now I have a working solution I can pass around the office easily. A basic macro reference a Python exe file located on a shared network drive. Meaning there is no python install! And we can populate PDF forms with a simple excel macro while still getting all the flexibility and functionality of Python. The rest of this post will be going through an example of how to fill out a PDF using python."
